I'm inspired by humans, our natural environment, and technology. As a generalist and social scientist, my curiosity drives me to continuously experiment in new spaces. I started out studying the past and am now focused on contributing to a sustainable future. 

My professional journey began as an archaeologist using Geographic Information Systems to model ancient Maya landscapes in Mexico and Guatemala. I conducted (foodways) research on food systems, plant foods, kitchens, and human behaviors surrounding food and environment. I often joke that I'm an expert in ancient Mexican/Maya food.

Since completing a PhD, I've worked in the public sector and private industry solving sociotechnical problems in a variety of roles. In 2021 I moved from my native California to Berlin, Germany where I circled back to familiar GIS territory at a startup that uses satellite data to work on sustainability. 
 
In my free time you can find me backpacking, slacklining, cooking and gardening, attending metal and other concerts, reading scifi and other literature.
