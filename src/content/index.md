I'm inspired by all things related to humans and technology. My journey into software began as an archaeologist using Geographic Information Systems to model ancient Maya landscapes in Mexico and Guatemala.

After completing a PhD, I transitioned into a Product Manager role at the University of California. Throughout my experiences studying humans and building tools to aid human activities, I cultivated a deep respect for technical systems that are intuitive and accessible. Eventually I decided to learn how to build things myself.

When Iâ€™m not creating delightful user experiences you can find me climbing, slacklining, backpacking, attending metal and other concerts, reading scifi and other literature.
