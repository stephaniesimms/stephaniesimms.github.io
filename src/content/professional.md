This is a collection of various professional pursuits: archaeology, building communities of practice in open research data policy, and dabbles in software engineering.

## Short Bio
There will be some content but in the interim have a look at my reasonably up-to-date [resume](/resume/stephanie_simms_resume.pdf)

## Archaeology
As an archaeologist I studied ancient human-environment interactions, sustainability and resilience, and agricultural risk management through the lens of food (i.e., foodways). I conducted 10 years of field research in the New World tropical Maya culture area of Yucat√°n, Mexico and Guatemala, and received funding from the US National Science Foundation, Smithsonian Institution, and Boston University.
 
I was once featured in a National Geographic documentary.

## Open data policy
After completing a PhD, I became a Product Manager at the University of California Office of the President where I built data repositories, communities of practice around open data policy, and coached researchers in best practices for research data management. I received a US National Science Foundation grant to create machine-actionable data management plans and established a partnership with the UK Digital Curation Centre to coordinate the effort across global open data policies.

## Software engineering portfolio
Eventually I decided to take a method acting approach and learn how to build things myself. I completed a full-stack software engineering bootcamp at Rithm School that included an internship where I discovered that I'm a generalist at heart and enjoy solving human problems more than technical ones. From there I ventured into technical consulting and engineering project management roles at startups.
