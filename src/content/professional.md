This is a collection of various professional pursuits: archaeology, building communities of practice in open access/open data, and dabbles in software engineering.

## Short Bio
There will be some content but in the interim have a look at my reasonably up-to-date [resume](/resume/stephanie_simms_resume.pdf)

What gives me purpose now? Reconnect to research focus on food, food systems, cultural logics and human behaviors surrounding food and environment. My journey, the narrative thread 
 
Throughout my experiences studying humans and building tools to aid human activities, I cultivated a deep respect for technical systems that are intuitive and accessible. 

My PhD in Archaeology is from Boston University and before that I completed a BA in Classics at UCLA.

## Archaeology
As an archaeologist I studied ancient human-environment interactions, sustainability and resilience, and agricultural risk management through the lens of food. I conducted 10 years of field research in the New World tropical Maya culture area of Yucat√°n, Mexico and Guatemala, and received funding from the US National Science Foundation, Smithsonian Institution, and Boston University.
 
I was once featured in a National Geographic documentary.

## Open data policy
After completing a PhD, I became a Product Manager at the University of California Office of the President where I built data repositories, communities of practice around open data policy, and coached researchers in best practices for research data management. I received a US National Science Foundation grant to create machine-actionable data management plans and established a partnership with the UK Digital Curation Centre to coordinate the effort across global open data policies.

## Software engineering portfolio
Eventually I decided to take a method acting approach and learn how to build things myself. I completed a full-stack software engineering bootcamp at Rithm School that included an internship where I discovered that I'm a generalist at heart and enjoy solving human problems more than technical ones. From there I ventured into technical consulting and engineering project management roles at startups.
