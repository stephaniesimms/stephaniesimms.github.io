<p class="message">
  I am a Research Data Specialist at the California Digital Library and Product Manager for the [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/). In both roles I provide the 10 University of California campuses and beyond with technical, educational, and policy-related support for research data management and open scholarship initiatives. My current focus is coordinating global efforts to transform data management plans from an annoying administrative exercise into a useful tool for researchers, funders, and other stakeholders.

  Prior to joining the CDL I was a [CLIR Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.clir.org/fellowships/postdoc) at UCLA where I worked on geospatial data and data publishing projects. My own archaeological research experiences involved plenty of challenges with managing and sharing myriad types of data, both physical and digital, and inform my current work. I received a PhD in Archaeology from Boston University and a BA in Classics from UCLA.
