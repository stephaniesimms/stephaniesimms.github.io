I am a seasoned product manager, academic researcher, and user-centered design enthusiast. Currently I'm attending [Rithm School](https://www.rithmschool.com/), a web development bootcamp, to parlay my background into building technology that aids (rather than frustrates) humans.

Throughout my experiences leading international research teams and a distributed team of developers collaborating on the open source [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/) project, I cultivated a deep respect for technical systems that are intuitive and accessible to as many users as possible.

When I'm not delving into the complex interplay between humans and technology you can find me climbing, cycling, backpacking, cooking, gardening, attending metal concerts, reading scifi.
