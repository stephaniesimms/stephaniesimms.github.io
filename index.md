Following on my first career transition from academic archaeologist (PhD 2014, Boston University) to Product Manager and Research Data Specialist at the University of California, I am studying to pursue roles in front end web design and development.

Throughout my experiences leading international research teams and then a distributed team of developers collaborating on the open source [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/) project, I cultivated a deep respect for technical systems that facilitate and enhance human pursuits. Now I want to contribute to building things that are intuitive and accessible to as many users as possible.
